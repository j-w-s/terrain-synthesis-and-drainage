terrain generation and visualization using noise algorithms. the program generates heightmaps with value noise and fractional brownian motion (fbm), applies terrain modifiers, calculates drainage patterns, and visualizes the terrain in both 2d and 3d.
do whatever with this code -- i didn't design the algorithms
